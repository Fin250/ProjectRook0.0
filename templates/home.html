                    <p>"Lisa generously shares the fruits of her extensive and ongoing Red School training with the women she supports in her groups, retreats and drop-in sessions. She has a magical ability to hold space for women, and teaches authentically and from the heart. I've found her work around the inner critic and menstrual cycle awareness instrumental in helping my own menopause transition. If you're interested in learning more about how you can work with your cycle, not against it, Lisa is your girl!"</p>

                    <p>"Everything I’ve done with Lisa has been both brilliant and insightful (tarot readings, menstrual cycle awareness, retreat day, circles).

                    Lisa is extremely knowledgeable and full of wisdom (in general) but especially around how we can harness the power of our menstrual cycle and beyond, into menopause.

                    She has a gentle intuitive way and holds space beautifully, making everything accessible - highly recommend."</p>

                    <p>"Empowering women through cycle awareness, self-care, and intuitive guidance.
                    Lisa creates a safe, nurturing space for women to connect with their bodies and cycles. Her guidance in menstrual tracking has transformed my understanding of my emotions, relationships, and well-being. She’s helped me prepare for perimenopause with confidence and embrace my cycle as a source of wisdom. Every session is calming, insightful, and empowering—I highly recommend Lisa's Luna Moth Menstrual Cycle Awareness Course for any woman on this journey."</p>
